## The Formation of the Meridian Library District

There are two eras in the history of libraries in Meridian, Idaho. The first era covers the Meridian Occident Club and spans from 1924 to 1974. The second era covers the creation of the Meridian Library District in 1974 and continues to the present day. 

On July 17, 1924 the newly created Meridian Occident Club, a womenâ€™s civic organization committed to charity work and the betterment of Meridian, formed a library committee to establish a traveling library. In September of that year they opened a traveling library at Songer Pharmacy with only a handful of books. By 1930 the club purchased a building to hold their club meetings and to house the public library. For the next 44 years, the Occident Club maintained the library and expanded its size to meet a continually growing population (for more information on the Meridian Occident Club, visit our Meridian Occident Club digital collection). 

In May 1974, the library began a significant transformation period and entered a new era. Due to rapid population growth in Meridian and the surrounding area, the Meridian Occident Club desired to turn their library over to the Ada County Commissioners to form a library district. Previous to this time, the Occident Club regularly received money from the city of Meridian to run the library (called The Meridian Public Library), but despite this assistance more organizational power and resources were needed to respond to changing times. Two of the factors driving this desired change were first, the increasing difficulty of a volunteer organization to help run the library in the midst of a growing patronage, and second, that individuals in the expanding rural area just outside of Meridian also wanted access to a public library. 

While several individuals outside of Meridian wanted taxation in order to have access to a public library, the Occident Club created a petition to form the Meridian Free Library District (MFLD). The process was not necessarily easy. Once enough signatures were gathered supporting the move, the Ada County Commissioners needed to discuss the matter in a meeting held on July 16.  Upon deliberation, the commissioners established August 27, 1974 as the official date for the involved public to vote on whether to form the library district. The election proved successful, but in the process one library became two libraries. 

How did one library entity become two libraries? Residents within the city of Meridian were not allowed to vote in the MFLD election because they were already served by the Meridian Public Library. Only those outside of Meridian in a specified area, wanting taxation for a library, were allowed to vote. Once the election proved successful, the Occident Club agreed to provide space for the MFLD in their Club building at a rate of one dollar per year. As a result, two libraries were now in existence, the Meridian Public Library and the MFLD, both housed in the same location (18 E. Idaho Ave). 

Those supporting the petition for the MFLD were aware that this was how the transition would occur. It was planned from the beginning by those involved that when the MFLD formed the Meridian Public Library and the new district library should merge under one name, with both eventually becoming one united Meridian Free Library District. To secure this action another vote was necessary in which the citizens within the Meridian Public Library service area and the Meridian Free Library District needed to agree on a merger. Until this was able to occur, these two libraries operated with Grove Koger as the Meridian Free Library District librarian and Mrs. Nancy Sage as the Meridian Public Library librarian. The wheels of procedure might have taken longer than anticipated, but on August 26, 1975 the citizens of Meridian Public Library area voted to join the District (90-10), and those in the MFLD area voted (29-3) to accept the citizens of the Meridian Library District into one merged library district. Thus, the Meridian Library District started in 1974 and grew in public coverage in the merger of 1975.
