## The Formation of the Meridian Library District

There are two eras in the history of libraries in Meridian, Idaho. The first era covers the Meridian Occident Club and spans from 1924 to 1974. The second era covers the creation of the Meridian Library District in 1974 and continues to the present day. 

On July 17, 1924 the newly created Meridian Occident Club, a women’s civic organization committed to charity work and the betterment of Meridian, formed a library committee to establish a traveling library. In September of that year they opened a traveling library at Songer Pharmacy with only a handful of books. By 1930 the club purchased a building to hold their club meetings and to house the public library. For the next 44 years, the Occident Club maintained the library and expanded its size to meet a continually growing population (for more information on the Meridian Occident Club, visit our Meridian Occident Club digital collection). 

In May 1974, the library began a significant transformation period and entered a new era. Due to rapid population growth in Meridian and the surrounding area, the Meridian Occident Club desired to turn their library over to the Ada County Commissioners to form a library district. Previous to this time, the Occident Club regularly received money from the city of Meridian to run the library (called The Meridian Public Library), but despite this assistance more organizational power and resources were needed to respond to changing times. Two of the factors driving this desired change were first, the increasing difficulty of a volunteer organization to help run the library in the midst of a growing patronage, and second, that individuals in the expanding rural area just outside of Meridian also wanted access to a public library. 

While several individuals outside of Meridian wanted taxation in order to have access to a public library, the Occident Club created a petition to form the Meridian Free Library District (MFLD). The process was not necessarily easy. Once enough signatures were gathered supporting the move, the Ada County Commissioners needed to discuss the matter in a meeting held on July 16.  Upon deliberation, the commissioners established August 27, 1974 as the official date for the involved public to vote on whether to form the library district. The election proved successful, but in the process one library became two libraries. 

How did one library entity become two libraries? Residents within the city of Meridian were not allowed to vote in the MFLD election because they were already served by the Meridian Public Library. Only those outside of Meridian in a specified area, wanting taxation for a library, were allowed to vote. Once the election proved successful, the Occident Club agreed to provide space for the MFLD in their Club building at a rate of one dollar per year. As a result, two libraries were now in existence, the Meridian Public Library and the MFLD, both housed in the same location (18 E. Idaho Ave). 

Those supporting the petition for the MFLD were aware that this was how the transition would occur. It was planned from the beginning by those involved that when the MFLD formed the Meridian Public Library and the new district library should merge under one name, with both eventually becoming one united Meridian Free Library District. To secure this action another vote was necessary in which the citizens within the Meridian Public Library service area and the Meridian Free Library District needed to agree on a merger. Until this was able to occur, these two libraries operated with Grove Koger as the Meridian Free Library District librarian and Mrs. Nancy Sage as the Meridian Public Library librarian. The wheels of procedure might have taken longer than anticipated, but on August 26, 1975 the citizens of Meridian Public Library area voted to join the District (90-10), and those in the MFLD area voted (29-3) to accept the citizens of the Meridian Library District into one merged library district. Thus, the Meridian Library District started in 1974 and grew in public coverage in the merger of 1975.

In the years following the merger, the Meridian Library District continued forward with the same zeal of community involvement and public service. Library circulation continued to flourish with yearly circulation totals jumping significantly in its first few years. In 1977 the yearly circulation total for the library was 46,562 items, by 1978 that number increased to 53, 498 items, and by 1980 a significant 65,080 items circulated. Comparing this latter number to the 6,658 population figure for Meridian in 1980, this breaks down to just less than ten circulated items per person. 

While humans took great interest in the library, some animals soon found the library their home. Early in MLD history, the library cared for  a pair of gerbils named Dot and Dash. In September of 1976 a three month old black and white cat adopted the library. The library staff named him Figaro, after the cat in Disney's version of Pinocchio. Adults and children alike enjoyed his presence in the community and Figaro quickly rose up to be the library's greeter and “press relations purrson.” Perhaps the only individuals that might have been weary of Figaro’s presence were Dot and Dash, whose cage was always placed in the bathroom at nighttime when the librarians went home at night. This was to keep Figaro from harassing them. Unfortunately, in December of 1980, Figaro passed away due to injuries he suffered months previous. However, his few years' presence at the library remains a memorable aspect of the library district’s history.

During the 1970s and 1980s the library sponsored important activities to increase child literacy and foster education. Every summer MLD held, (and continues to hold to this day) a Summer Reading Program for when children are out of school for the summer. Librarians held weekly children’s activities with special guests such as magician acts, a smokejumper, and a lesson on lassoing by Myla Meiers, a Caldwell Night Rodeo champion. On January 19, 1982, MLD initiated a storytime for preschoolers. Of the event librarian Gaye Walter declared, “We hope this program for pre-schoolers will become a weekly event.” The hope was realized. To this day, MLD continues to hold storytimes as one of their most attended and popular activities.

MLD also continued to expand their collections to benefit adults in the community. In May of 1982, the library dedicated the Nancy S. Sage and Carl H. Rathjen Idaho Collection, named after Sage, who was a longtime librarian in Meridian, and Carl Rathjen who served on the original MLD city library board and was a popular local author with sixteen novels and various short stories. True to its name, the Idaho Collection housed books that took place in Idaho, were about Idaho, or were written by Idaho authors. The collection even included many out of print publications, likely contributing to the delight of older patrons.

In April 1984 the Meridian Library District initiated a $50,000 building expansion project for the library. The most recently completed expansion had been just ten years earlier in 1974, when the Occident Club prepared to put their foot forward for a library district. The need for a library expansion ten years later indicated that Meridian only continued to grow in population. Highlights of this expansion included 800 square feet of additional space with tables and a reference area for adult patrons, 800 square feet of existing space newly designated for children (including a life sized teddy bear), and new carpeting throughout the whole building. The library increased in size by forty percent (Harriet Guthertz, Construction to end on Library in Meridian, Idaho Statesman, Wednesday July 11, 1984).
